            <h3> Overview </h3>
            <p>
              A free-to-use personal safety application that can be accessed by anyone with a mobile device, starting with residents based in Australia.
              For those individuals who have ever felt unsafe walking home, whether it be in the dark or the daylight, for those who like to take spontaneous
              late-night runs, or regularly take public transport or haven’t felt safe in any activity on their own outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s primary purpose as a personal safety application will see the user’s own mobile device allow their GPS data to be monitored, checking for
              regular routes from ‘safe’ locations such as work and home. When active, deviations from pre-programmed routes or access to ‘safe’ locations
              will alert emergency contacts first, and with no user-input, contact emergency services for assistance.
            </p>

            <h4> Motivation </h4>
            <p>
              In the wake of more disappearances of women across the globe – Sarah Everard (London), Jasmeen Kaur (Adelaide) 9via 9news.com and news.com.au)
              – the discussion of feeling safe on your walk home or on a night out has been brought up again and again. I myself have had numerous
              conversations with friends about feeling unsafe on public transport to the point where we have stayed on past our stop, or when walking home
              alone we have called someone to meet us halfway or stay on the phone the whole way home to make sure we make it there safely. I am safe; many
              are not.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn’t to say it is a women’s only issue or will be a women’s only safety application. It can be a tool used by parents to make sure their
              kids make to and from school without harm, or for people to make sure their friends make it home from the gym or a night out. Many personal safety
              applications currently have feature stuck behind paywalls, making their most important features inaccessible to individuals who may need them the most.
            </p>

            <h4> Description </h4>
            <p>
              This mobile application is ultimately meant to be used as a personal safety device, working in conjunction with the GPS of the user’s mobile
              device. It is an application for anyone that has ever experienced the unpleasantness of a dangerous or risky situation, an intimidating walk
              home alone or a menace on public transport. It is a preventative tool, to ensure the users safety as they make the journey from one place to
              the next, with the peace of mind that their location is being recorded and help is not that far away.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application will give users the ability to program in ‘safe’ locations, such as places of residence, workplaces, friends and family dwellings,
              and set preferred routes between locations. Users would then set their designated deviation limit; the limit of which they were comfortable deviating
              from the pre-set route, in case of any interruptions (roadworks, lights outs, missed stops etc) between their original location and their destination.
              If no deviation limit entered into the journey, 2km will be used as the default, as this gives a significant radius of departure allowing for the above
              disturbances but is not substantial enough to miss any dubious movements.
            </p>
            <p>
              If this limit were to be breached, the user’s emergency contacts would be notified with a message advising them the user had left their designated safe
              route and could require assistance shortly. The emergency contact would receive a copy of the user’s location. A warning would appear on the screen
              for the user to dismiss (access with password/touch ID) if this was an error or if the user forgot to bypass/change the route being taken. The app
              would then automatically notify their emergency contacts that everything was okay and renounce the previous message.
            </p>
            <p>
              If for any reason they fail to dismiss the warning within a 30-60 second timeframe (as determined in their user settings), the emergency contacts would
              receive another notification stating that the user was now in danger, and emergency services will be contacted. They would also receive another
              notification of the user’s location. If the user follows the predetermined routes all the way from one location to another, no action would be required.
            </p>
            <p>
              A personal safety application for a mobile device is not a new concept. They have been done many times before, but in my research, the majority that I came
              across had numerous features that were locked behind paywalls, making their most imperative features inaccessible to their users. Making this concept as a free-to-use
              application will eliminate this barrier to users, and hopefully more individuals will decide to make use of one.
            </p>

            <h4> Outcome </h4>
            <p>
              If successful, the personal safety application will be available for free for users in Australia to download and use as their needs require.
              Theoretically, it could help users feel more secure in their previously uncertain and unsafe ventures between home and other locations, or
              on public transport. If successful, the model then could be enhanced to version 2, allowing for further features, such as the ability for
              select authorised users to check route movement live as it happens if a user requests them to do so, and the integration of public transport
              routes, or a help (panic) button.
