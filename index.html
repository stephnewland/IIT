                <p>
                  I was born and raised in here in Australia, however, due to my father’s nationality, I am technically half-Australian, half-German.
                  Due to a chronic illness, I completed my ATAR in the year after I was supposed to graduate and have since studied a Bachelor of Creative
                  Industries at ECU. I paused these studies this year to commence at RMIT as I wanted to change up my studies and move into a degree that I
                  thought was better suited to the career I aspire to have.

                  Fun fact: I have an identical twin sister. Before you ask, here are the answers to some of the most common questions: I am the youngest
                  by seven minutes (sorry mom). Yes, we’re really that identical, down to our voices and mannerisms. People confuse us all the time, even our
                  parents. And yes, we did indeed play the classic ‘twins-switch-places’ prank on our teachers and switch classes when we were younger – more
                  than once (it was hilarious every time).
