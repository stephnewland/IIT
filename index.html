          <h2> Personal Information </h2>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in here in Australia, however, due to my father’s nationality, I am technically half-Australian, half-German.
              Due to a chronic illness, I completed my ATAR in the year after I was supposed to graduate and have since studied a Bachelor of Creative
              Industries at ECU. I paused these studies this year to commence at RMIT as I wanted to change up my studies and move into a degree that I
              thought was better suited to the career I aspire to have.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fun fact: I have an identical twin sister. Before you ask, here are the answers to some of the most common questions: I am the youngest
              by seven minutes (sorry mom). Yes, we’re really that identical, down to our voices and mannerisms. People confuse us all the time, even our
              parents. And yes, we did indeed play the classic ‘twins-switch-places’ prank on our teachers and switch classes when we were younger – more
              than once (it was hilarious every time).

          <h2> Interest in It </h2>
                <p>
                  My interest in IT began when I was a child. I was always fascinated with the technology that was around us, to the point where I was
                  always playing with something than I probably should have been. It got to the point where my dad began to let me watch and then finally
                  help with what he was doing when he was fixing various items around the house (the TV/radio/PlayStation 1 remote, etc) instead of telling me
                  ‘I probably shouldn’t be touching that.’
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I was old enough to get my first laptop, the obsession continued, and I was able to figure out how to fix items on my own. I then looked
                  into learning how to use a bunch of different software that appealed to my interests (Photoshop, Illustrator, BBEdit, Atom, and many more)
                  before exploring different programming languages. As an ardent reader, technology, and sub-categories such as ethical hacking, programming,
                  and AI, have found their ways into my standard reading assortment, allowing me to further develop my understanding. And now here I am finally,
                  studying and formally learning how to understand and work in the subject that’s always seized my attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During my studies I hope to learn more about the information technology as a whole, as well as the impact it has on the world. I would like
                  to further develop the basic skills I already have, in web design (HTML/CSS) and in programming languages (Java/Python) as well as learn a
                  range of new skills and delve into other useful programming languages that may be helpful in ant future career I may pursue.

                    I am not one hundred percent certain on the direction I want to head in the world of IT, however, there has been an area of interest that
                    has always appealed to me throughout my studies and personal research within the IT industry. Despite being heavily stereotyped through
                    its representation in the media, the field of cyber security has continually been a fascination and a direction I have looked into. Both
                    roles I found for this assignment that I thought might be a potential career path were also within this area and are the positions of Cyber
                    Security Analyst and Penetration Tester.

                    <p>
                    I would begin by completing my degree through RMIT, as well as undertaking independent study through Udemy, Skillshare, or Coursera to build upon
                    current knowledge and develop new skills that may be useful in the future. From there, I would simultaneously work on the further development of
                    my current skills in Java and Python. PowerShell has also been mentioned in quite a few job advertisements I have seen
                    for Cyber Security Analysts so it may be a good program to begin to learn over the next year or two.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, further development of my understanding of computer networking would be worked on, before the commencement of study on database security
                    and malware detection software (of which may be covered in future courses, or in a future degree structure with RMIT or another provider, but it
                    is always good to be prepared). I would then look into a Bachelor’s Degree in Cyber Security and then into any relevant certificates as required
                    (Risk Management, Penetration Testing, CompTIA A+ certification).

                    <h3> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [MBTI] </h3>
                    </br>

                    <h4> INFJ-T: ‘The Advocate’ </h4>
                    <h4> Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
                    <p>
                      Creative and insightful. Always looking past appearances to discover true motivations and needs to find the perfect solution to a problem.
                      Spends active time in their imagination and daydreams, using their strong sense of compassion and understanding to discover actuality and key
                      resolutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Principled and passionate. Holds strong beliefs and sincerity and assurance of values are shown when discussing matters close to heart. As an
                      advocate, we can be considered to be persuasive and exciting communicators, showing off our enthusiastic nature to those who are listening.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Perfectionist. Strives for constant improvement, sometimes to the point of perfectionism, leading to procrastination and the perpetual need for
                      something more. Our sometime obsessive nature can cause us to purse our beliefs with tenacity, focusing on nothing else, disrupting those around
                      us, and leaving others less than pleased.
                    <</p>
                    <p>
                      Altruism and fears. Has fears that are known to be irrational (stemming from the idealised perfectionism they struggle with), however, tend to be
                      altruistic in nature; working past apprehensions and using their strengths and eagerness for the greater good and to help others to succeed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Criticism and conflict. While striving for excellence, they tend to be sensitive to criticism, especially if their values and ideologies are
                      challenged, and can become defensive and negative in response. They do not respond well to conflict at all and try to avoid it all costs.
                      In turn, they are then reluctant to open up with thoughts and feelings when facing criticism and conflict but are also very private individuals.
                      They value honesty, so you can expect straightforward and sincere discussion, but they may not be able to open up with their thoughts and feelings
                      in return.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Burnout. Due to their perfectionist traits, inability to share and want for more, INFJ-T Advocates are prone to burnout if they can’t find a way to
                      balance out the drive and sense of accomplishment they compel.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Team Composition </h4>
                    <p>
                      INFJ-T Advocates are likely to purse careers that align with their values and ideologies, over one that offers financial significance or positions of
                      importance. Their altruistic nature, desire to connect and ability to communicate efficiently and effectively make them strong contenders for
                      leadership roles. Their standards of creativity, ingenuity and autonomy allow them to exercise their direction and leadership and help others excel.
                      To feel genuinely fulfilled in their role, they will need a sense of independence, and work that supports their ideologies while allowing them to
                      explore a range of opportunities, while reinforcing their team’s organisation. I feel like this is true to my personality, as while I enjoy working
                      as part of a team, I thrive on my independence and the chance to do my work to the best of my ability. I do, however, know when I am defeated, and
                      required help, and would ask for it.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <h4> Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
                    <p>
                    High results in agreeableness and conscientiousness show that at the time of taking the test, my outcomes show I am compassionate, good-natured, and prefer
                    cooperation to conflict and competition (also seen above in the INFJ-T criticism and conflict trait).The results also reflect that I am dedicated to my work,
                    have a clear sense of duty, am well disciplined, organised and appreciates precise details, in both my work, study and personal life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Existing results show that a very low score on extraversion, finding it easier to be reserved in my feelings and come across as quite formal and reserved.
                    It also displays that I would prefer to work alone, and avoid direct leadership roles, which is in complete disagreement with the Myers-Briggs result of
                    INFJ-T ‘Advocate’ of which show strong leadership characteristics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    A higher natural reactions result shows feelings of anxiety and worry, especially in stressful situations. However, this could just be residual feelings
                    from the mindset of when the test was taken, as this result has varied each time I have taken this test previously. Generally, I work well under
                    pressure, which you could not determine from this type of test. The mid-range score for openness to experience describes my personality as creative-leaning,
                    imaginative yet practical, and of favouring detail and technical problem-solving.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Team Composition </h4>
                    <p>
                      As mentioned above, the extraversion score is in direct opposition to the Myers-Briggs result which considered INFJ-T types to be prominent leaders.
                      This could have been the result of the mentality I had when approaching the test, which I would need to be mindful of when setting tasks, not only
                      for myself but for others if I did take on a leadership role. As someone who is generally introverted in their day-to-day life, I do not disagree with
                      the very low score on the extraversion scale, however, if required (as it is in my work) I would work through any anxiety and apprehension and
                      communicate with those around me to ensure that work was being prioritised as needed and everyone was on the same page.

                    <h4> Primary Learning Style </h4>
                    <h4> Theorist </h4>

                    <p>
                      I prefer to think problems through in a logical manner, valuing rationality and objectivity over emotions and sentimentality. Theorists
                      are disciplined, aim to fit matter into rational order, assimilate contrasting facts into coherent theory. Learning methods that suit
                      theories include models, classroom response systems, story-telling, quotes, tutorials (in conjunction with practicals).

                    <h4> Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
                    <p>
                      While disciplined, can be narrow-minded on one model of thought, and focus heavily on that concept until fully understood. This could be
                      a problem when content moves quickly, or when speed is a necessity. On the other side, the logical manner in which learning is approached
                      leaves little room for oversight, and concepts are fully comprehended before moving along (sometimes to the detriment of the timeline).
                    </p>

                      The ability to think rationality is helpful when leading a team, but also a valuable tool when participating as part of a group.
                      I believe based on the learning styles given, I would learn and respond better to a role as part of the group, rather than as a leader,
                      dependant on the individual leading the group. They would have to present information logically, or potentially as an anecdote for me
                      to fully appreciate and comprehend.

        <h2> Project Idea </h2>
          <div class="sectionContent">
            <article>
              <h3> Overview </h3>
              <p>
                A free-to-use personal safety application that can be accessed by anyone with a mobile device, starting with residents based in Australia.
                For those individuals who have ever felt unsafe walking home, whether it be in the dark or the daylight, for those who like to take spontaneous
                late-night runs, or regularly take public transport or haven’t felt safe in any activity on their own outside.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s primary purpose as a personal safety application will see the user’s own mobile device allow their GPS data to be monitored, checking for
                regular routes from ‘safe’ locations such as work and home. When active, deviations from pre-programmed routes or access to ‘safe’ locations
                will alert emergency contacts first, and with no user-input, contact emergency services for assistance.
              </p>

              <h4> Motivation </h4>
              <p>
                In the wake of more disappearances of women across the globe – Sarah Everard (London), Jasmeen Kaur (Adelaide) 9via 9news.com and news.com.au)
                – the discussion of feeling safe on your walk home or on a night out has been brought up again and again. I myself have had numerous
                conversations with friends about feeling unsafe on public transport to the point where we have stayed on past our stop, or when walking home
                alone we have called someone to meet us halfway or stay on the phone the whole way home to make sure we make it there safely. I am safe; many
                are not.
              </p>
              <p>
                This isn’t to say it is a women’s only issue or will be a women’s only safety application. It can be a tool used by parents to make sure their
                kids make to and from school without harm, or for people to make sure their friends make it home from the gym or a night out. Many personal safety
                applications currently have feature stuck behind paywalls, making their most important features inaccessible to individuals who may need them the most.
              </p>

              <h4> Description </h4>
              <p>
                This mobile application is ultimately meant to be used as a personal safety device, working in conjunction with the GPS of the user’s mobile
                device. It is an application for anyone that has ever experienced the unpleasantness of a dangerous or risky situation, an intimidating walk
                home alone or a menace on public transport. It is a preventative tool, to ensure the users safety as they make the journey from one place to
                the next, with the peace of mind that their location is being recorded and help is not that far away.
              </p>
              <p>
                The application will give users the ability to program in ‘safe’ locations, such as places of residence, workplaces, friends and family dwellings,
                and set preferred routes between locations. Users would then set their designated deviation limit; the limit of which they were comfortable deviating
                from the pre-set route, in case of any interruptions (roadworks, lights outs, missed stops etc) between their original location and their destination.
                If no deviation limit entered into the journey, 2km will be used as the default, as this gives a significant radius of departure allowing for the above
                disturbances but is not substantial enough to miss any dubious movements.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this limit were to be breached, the user’s emergency contacts would be notified with a message advising them the user had left their designated safe
                route and could require assistance shortly. The emergency contact would receive a copy of the user’s location. A warning would appear on the screen
                for the user to dismiss (access with password/touch ID) if this was an error or if the user forgot to bypass/change the route being taken. The app
                would then automatically notify their emergency contacts that everything was okay and renounce the previous message.
              </p>
              <p>
                If for any reason they fail to dismiss the warning within a 30-60 second timeframe (as determined in their user settings), the emergency contacts would
                receive another notification stating that the user was now in danger, and emergency services will be contacted. They would also receive another
                notification of the user’s location. If the user follows the predetermined routes all the way from one location to another, no action would be required.
              </p>
              <p>
                A personal safety application for a mobile device is not a new concept. They have been done many times before, but in my research, the majority that I came
                across had numerous features that were locked behind paywalls, making their most imperative features inaccessible to their users. Making this concept as a free-to-use
                application will eliminate this barrier to users, and hopefully more individuals will decide to make use of one.
              </p>

              <h4> Outcome </h4>
              <p>
                If successful, the personal safety application will be available for free for users in Australia to download and use as their needs require.
                Theoretically, it could help users feel more secure in their previously uncertain and unsafe ventures between home and other locations, or
                on public transport. If successful, the model then could be enhanced to version 2, allowing for further features, such as the ability for
                select authorised users to check route movement live as it happens if a user requests them to do so, and the integration of public transport
                routes, or a help (panic) button.
