                <h3> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator [MBTI] </h3>

                <h4> INFJ-T: ‘The Advocate’ </h4>
                <h4> Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
                <p>
                  Creative and insightful. Always looking past appearances to discover true motivations and needs to find the perfect solution to a problem.
                  Spends active time in their imagination and daydreams, using their strong sense of compassion and understanding to discover actuality and key
                  resolutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Principled and passionate. Holds strong beliefs and sincerity and assurance of values are shown when discussing matters close to heart. As an
                  advocate, we can be considered to be persuasive and exciting communicators, showing off our enthusiastic nature to those who are listening.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Perfectionist. Strives for constant improvement, sometimes to the point of perfectionism, leading to procrastination and the perpetual need for
                  something more. Our sometime obsessive nature can cause us to purse our beliefs with tenacity, focusing on nothing else, disrupting those around
                  us, and leaving others less than pleased.
                <</p>
                <p>
                  Altruism and fears. Has fears that are known to be irrational (stemming from the idealised perfectionism they struggle with), however, tend to be
                  altruistic in nature; working past apprehensions and using their strengths and eagerness for the greater good and to help others to succeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Criticism and conflict. While striving for excellence, they tend to be sensitive to criticism, especially if their values and ideologies are
                  challenged, and can become defensive and negative in response. They do not respond well to conflict at all and try to avoid it all costs.
                  In turn, they are then reluctant to open up with thoughts and feelings when facing criticism and conflict but are also very private individuals.
                  They value honesty, so you can expect straightforward and sincere discussion, but they may not be able to open up with their thoughts and feelings
                  in return.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Burnout. Due to their perfectionist traits, inability to share and want for more, INFJ-T Advocates are prone to burnout if they can’t find a way to
                  balance out the drive and sense of accomplishment they compel.
                </p>

                <h4> Team Composition </h4>
                <p>
                  INFJ-T Advocates are likely to purse careers that align with their values and ideologies, over one that offers financial significance or positions of
                  importance. Their altruistic nature, desire to connect and ability to communicate efficiently and effectively make them strong contenders for
                  leadership roles. Their standards of creativity, ingenuity and autonomy allow them to exercise their direction and leadership and help others excel.
                  To feel genuinely fulfilled in their role, they will need a sense of independence, and work that supports their ideologies while allowing them to
                  explore a range of opportunities, while reinforcing their team’s organisation. I feel like this is true to my personality, as while I enjoy working
                  as part of a team, I thrive on my independence and the chance to do my work to the best of my ability. I do, however, know when I am defeated, and
                  required help, and would ask for it.
                </p>

                <h3> The Big Five Personality Test </h3>

                <div class="bigFiveImage">
                  <img class="bigFive" src="bigfive.jpg" alt="Big Five Personality Results of Steph Newland">
                </div>

                <h4> Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
                <p>
                High results in agreeableness and conscientiousness show that at the time of taking the test, my outcomes show I am compassionate, good-natured, and prefer
                cooperation to conflict and competition (also seen above in the INFJ-T criticism and conflict trait).The results also reflect that I am dedicated to my work,
                have a clear sense of duty, am well disciplined, organised and appreciates precise details, in both my work, study and personal life.
                </p>
                <p>
                Existing results show that a very low score on extraversion, finding it easier to be reserved in my feelings and come across as quite formal and reserved.
                It also displays that I would prefer to work alone, and avoid direct leadership roles, which is in complete disagreement with the Myers-Briggs result of
                INFJ-T ‘Advocate’ of which show strong leadership characteristics.
                </p>
                <p>
                A higher natural reactions result shows feelings of anxiety and worry, especially in stressful situations. However, this could just be residual feelings
                from the mindset of when the test was taken, as this result has varied each time I have taken this test previously. Generally, I work well under
                pressure, which you could not determine from this type of test. The mid-range score for openness to experience describes my personality as creative-leaning,
                imaginative yet practical, and of favouring detail and technical problem-solving.
                </p>

                <h4> Team Composition </h4>
                <p>
                  As mentioned above, the extraversion score is in direct opposition to the Myers-Briggs result which considered INFJ-T types to be prominent leaders.
                  This could have been the result of the mentality I had when approaching the test, which I would need to be mindful of when setting tasks, not only
                  for myself but for others if I did take on a leadership role. As someone who is generally introverted in their day-to-day life, I do not disagree with
                  the very low score on the extraversion scale, however, if required (as it is in my work) I would work through any anxiety and apprehension and
                  communicate with those around me to ensure that work was being prioritised as needed and everyone was on the same page.
                </p>

                <h3> Learning Styles Test </h3>

                <div class="learningStylesPic">
                  <img class="learningStyles" src="learningstyles.jpg" alt="Learning Styles Pie Chart for Steph Newland">
                </div>

                <h4> Primary Learning Style </h4>
                <h4> Theorist </h4>

                <p>
                  I prefer to think problems through in a logical manner, valuing rationality and objectivity over emotions and sentimentality. Theorists
                  are disciplined, aim to fit matter into rational order, assimilate contrasting facts into coherent theory. Learning methods that suit
                  theories include models, classroom response systems, story-telling, quotes, tutorials (in conjunction with practicals).

                <h4> Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
                <p>
                  While disciplined, can be narrow-minded on one model of thought, and focus heavily on that concept until fully understood. This could be
                  a problem when content moves quickly, or when speed is a necessity. On the other side, the logical manner in which learning is approached
                  leaves little room for oversight, and concepts are fully comprehended before moving along (sometimes to the detriment of the timeline).
                </p>

                <h4> Team Composition </h4>
                <p>
                  The ability to think rationality is helpful when leading a team, but also a valuable tool when participating as part of a group.
                  I believe based on the learning styles given, I would learn and respond better to a role as part of the group, rather than as a leader,
                  dependant on the individual leading the group. They would have to present information logically, or potentially as an anecdote for me
                  to fully appreciate and comprehend.
                </p>

                <h3> Learning Styles Test #2 </h3>

                <div class="learningStylesPic">
                  <img class="learningStylesTwo" src="learningstyles2.jpg" alt="Learning Styles Bar Chart for Steph Newland">
                </div>

                <h4> Primary Learning Style from Test #2 </h4>
                <h4> Kinaesthetic </h4>

                <p>
                This learning styles test shows that I am mostly a kinaesthetic or tactile learner. I learn better when I can create or work with my hands
                and can complete tasks by being involved through a hands-on learning experience. I also learn well visually, and can recall study more
                efficiently when I can physically take notes, make charts/posters, or can visualise spoken instruction into the written word.
                </p>
