                  I am not one hundred percent certain on the direction I want to head in the world of IT, however, there has been an area of interest that
                  has always appealed to me throughout my studies and personal research within the IT industry. Despite being heavily stereotyped through
                  its representation in the media, the field of cyber security has continually been a fascination and a direction I have looked into. Both
                  roles I found for this assignment that I thought might be a potential career path were also within this area and are the positions of Cyber
                  Security Analyst and Penetration Tester.

                          <ul>

                  <h4> Learning Plan </h4>
                  <p>
                  I would begin by completing my degree through RMIT, as well as undertaking independent study through Udemy, Skillshare, or Coursera to build upon
                  current knowledge and develop new skills that may be useful in the future. From there, I would simultaneously work on the further development of
                  my current skills in Java and Python. PowerShell has also been mentioned in quite a few job advertisements I have seen
                  for Cyber Security Analysts so it may be a good program to begin to learn over the next year or two.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then, further development of my understanding of computer networking would be worked on, before the commencement of study on database security
                  and malware detection software (of which may be covered in future courses, or in a future degree structure with RMIT or another provider, but it
                  is always good to be prepared). I would then look into a Bachelor’s Degree in Cyber Security and then into any relevant certificates as required
                  (Risk Management, Penetration Testing, CompTIA A+ certification).
